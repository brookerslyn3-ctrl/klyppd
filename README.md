## Preview

![Klyppd UI Preview](https://cdn.brookerslyn.space/klyppd%20preview1.png)

---

## Overview

Klyppd is a clipping and screen recording tool that prioritizes **low overhead**, **responsiveness**, and **user control**, all while remaining simple to use.

Unlike many existing clipping tools, Klyppd is designed to stay out of the way: minimal performance impact during gameplay, fast access to your most recent moments, and a workflow that gets clips from capture to shareable link in seconds.

---

## Features

### Fast GPU-Accelerated Recording

Klyppd uses [gpu-screen-recorder](https://git.dec05eba.com/gpu-screen-recorder) as its recording backend, enabling efficient clipping with minimal performance impact.

- Save the **last X seconds** of gameplay or desktop activity
- Fullscreen or window-specific recording
- Instant replay-style clipping
- Standard screen recording support
- Smart filenames generated from the active app (`Sober_2026-05-22.mp4`)

### Built-In Video Trimmer

A built-in trimmer powered by [FFmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg) lets you quickly cut clips without opening an external editor.

- Draggable in/out handles on a scrubbable timeline
- Save trim as a **copy** or **overwrite** the original
- Frame-accurate previews

### Cloud Uploading

Upload clips directly to your own **Cloudflare R2** bucket. Klyppd generates a small HTML embed page alongside the video file with proper OpenGraph and Twitter Card meta tags, so links unfurl into rich Discord / Twitter previews automatically.

- Custom domains
- Temporary or permanent uploads
- Short, branded share links
- Auto-expiring temp clips via R2 lifecycle rules

```txt
https://clip.example.com/t/abc123   # temporary
https://clip.example.com/p/abc123   # permanent
```

> Additional cloud providers are planned for future releases.

### Customization

Klyppd is designed to be tweakable. You can configure:

- **Themes** via plain CSS (`~/.config/klyppd/theme.css`)
- **Buffer duration**, FPS, codec, container, audio source
- **Hotkeys** through your window manager
- **Clip save location**

More advanced customization options are planned over time.

---

## How It Works

Klyppd acts as a frontend for `gpu-screen-recorder` while layering on:

- A graphical interface
- Clip management with thumbnails and metadata
- Upload integration
- Trimming tools
- Custom workflows

Hotkey integrations communicate with the running app through a Unix socket (`/tmp/klyppd.sock`), so triggers always read live from the app's settings — no shell scripts to keep in sync.

---

## Requirements

### Arch Linux

```bash
sudo pacman -S webkit2gtk-4.1 gpu-screen-recorder ffmpeg \
               gst-plugins-base gst-plugins-good gst-plugins-bad gst-libav
```

### Ubuntu / Debian

```bash
sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev gpu-screen-recorder ffmpeg \
                 gstreamer1.0-plugins-{base,good,bad} gstreamer1.0-libav
```

You also need a Rust toolchain (≥ 1.77) and Node.js (≥ 18) to build from source.

---

## Installation

### AUR (Arch Linux)

```bash
# Recommended — prebuilt binary, installs in seconds
yay -S klyppd-bin

# Or build from latest main (takes a few minutes)
yay -S klyppd-git
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brookerslyn/klyppd
cd klyppd
npm install
npm run tauri build -- --bundles deb
```

This produces a `.deb` at `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/deb/klyppd_0.1.0_amd64.deb`.

#### Install on Debian / Ubuntu

```bash
sudo dpkg -i src-tauri/target/release/bundle/deb/klyppd_0.1.0_amd64.deb
sudo apt -f install
```

#### Run without installing

```bash
./src-tauri/target/release/klyppd
```

### Development

```bash
npm run tauri dev
```

### Faster builds (recommended)

Install [mold](https://github.com/rui314/mold) for ~50% faster linking:

```bash
sudo pacman -S mold      # Arch
sudo apt install mold    # Debian/Ubuntu
```

The repo's `src-tauri/.cargo/config.toml` is preconfigured to use it.

---

## Configuration

Settings live in `~/.config/klyppd/settings.json` and are configured through the Settings tab in-app:

| Setting          | Description                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Frame rate       | Recording FPS                        |
| Codec            | h264 / hevc / av1                    |
| Container        | mp4 / mkv / webm                     |
| Audio source     | gpu-screen-recorder audio specifier  |
| Clip directory   | Where clips are saved locally        |
| Buffer duration  | Length of the replay buffer          |

### Cloudflare R2

In **Settings → Cloudflare R2**, fill in:

| Field          | Value                                                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Endpoint       | `https://<account_id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com`         |
| Bucket         | your bucket name                                        |
| Access Key     | from R2 → Manage API Tokens                             |
| Secret Key     | from R2 → Manage API Tokens                             |
| Custom Domain  | `https://cdn.yourdomain.com`                            |
| Temp expiry    | matches your bucket's lifecycle rule on the `t/` prefix |

Add a lifecycle rule on the `t/` prefix in your bucket settings to auto-delete temporary clips.

### Hotkeys

Klyppd is triggered through external keybinds that talk to the running app. Wire them up in your window manager / DE.

#### Hyprland

```ini
# hyprland.conf
bind = ALT,       R, exec, klyppd --cmd save-replay
bind = ALT SHIFT, R, exec, klyppd --cmd toggle-recording
bind = ALT,      F8, exec, klyppd --cmd toggle-buffer
```

```lua
-- hyprland-lua
hl.bind("ALT + R",         hl.dsp.exec_cmd("klyppd --cmd save-replay"))
hl.bind("ALT + SHIFT + R", hl.dsp.exec_cmd("klyppd --cmd toggle-recording"))
hl.bind("ALT + F8",        hl.dsp.exec_cmd("klyppd --cmd toggle-buffer"))
```

KDE / GNOME / other compositors: use any keybind manager that can run a shell command.

### Theming

Drop a `~/.config/klyppd/theme.css` file to override any of the CSS variables:

```css
:root {
  --bg-deepest: #0b0f12;
  --bg-base: #101418;
  --bg-elev-1: #181c20;
  --bg-elev-2: #1c2024;
  --bg-elev-3: #272a2e;
  --text: #e0e2e8;
  --text-dim: #c2c7cf;
  --text-muted: #8c9198;
  --accent: #9accfa;
  --border: #1c2024;
  --border-strong: #36393e;
}
```

## Project Status

Klyppd is under **active development**.

The current UI was heavily built with the help of AI-assisted tools to accelerate development as a solo project, so some parts of the interface may still feel experimental or inconsistent. The current focus is **performance, workflow, and functionality first** — UI polish and redesigns will continue over time.

---

## Roadmap

- [ ] Additional cloud providers (S3, MinIO, custom HTTP)
- [ ] Better UI customization
- [ ] Improved clip management (tags, folders, filters)
- [ ] In-app hotkey configuration
- [ ] Cross-platform support
- [ ] Automatic updates
- [ ] Better onboarding / setup experience
- [ ] AUR + AppImage releases

---
